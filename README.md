# Identification-Of-Parkinson-s-Disease-Using---ML
Parkinson’s disease is characterized by a decrease in dopamine production as a result of brain cell degeneration. Dopamine is in charge of communication between corridors. The part of the brain related with body control and ignorance of body movements. As a result, the complaint presents as a diapason of movement illnesses as well as non-motor characteristics. It is now demonstrated that non-motor symptoms can appear many times prior to the start of motor signs. as a result, timely and precise Opinion is critical in deciding whether to halt or slow the process. The complaint was stopped in its tracks. In this context, ensemble Boosting algorithms, for example, are examples of machine literacy (ML) algorithms contribute significantly to the early identification of Parkinson’s disease early stage. One of the Machine Learning methods i.e K-Nearesh Neighbours models are investigated in this work. and implemented in the UCI Parkinson’s Disease dataset. Following a thorough examination In terms of simulation, the ML model produced satisfactory results. of several performance factors such as delicacy, perfection,F1- Score, AUC, Youden, particularity, and mistake rate are all measures of recall.
